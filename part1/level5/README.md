# Level 5

Customers are always on the lookup for the best deals. So let's meet their expectations.

## Instructions

First of all, we have decided to replace `contract_length` with `start_date` and `end_date`

A customer can then change its contract's provider, and here are the steps:
- the yearly fee must be updated accordingly
- the cancellation fee (50â‚¬) is immediately applied to the `provider_fee`

To make things easier, you can assume the difference between `start_date` and `end_date` is always in terms of years (day and month are the same).

Write code that generates `output.json` from `data.json`
