# Selectra Technical Challenge

Welcome to Selectra's technical tests suite. In this game, you will be building a simple billing service.

## Instructions

- Clone this repository
- Solve as many levels as you can, and in ascending order
- Commit your code at the end of each level
- Give `part2` a try, even if you have not fully finished `part1`
- Email rh+tech@selectra.info when you are done, with a link to your GitHub repository!

Levels become more complex over time, so you will probably have to re-use some code and adapt it to the new requirements.

## Requirements

- Pick either **PHP** or **Ruby**
- Clean, readable and robust code
- Follow Software Development best practices

Please do try to do the simplest thing that could work first.
